# Stock Market RNN Predictions

This repository contains the implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for stock price prediction using historical data of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT).

## Overview
The project aims to predict future stock prices based on historical data using RNNs. The implementation is done in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and is documented in Jupyter notebooks.

## Datasets
- **AAPL_storico.csv**: Historical stock data for Apple Inc.
- **MSFT_storico.csv**: Historical stock data for Microsoft Corporation.

## Notebooks
- **AAPL_storico_RNN.ipynb**: Implementation of RNN for AAPL stock data.
- **MSFT_storico_RNN.ipynb**: Implementation of RNN for MSFT stock data.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks, you need the following Python packages:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
